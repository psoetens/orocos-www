By default, they will be sent a temporary password and one-time login URL that will not work, since their account will initially be blocked. It is better to put the initial login information into the notification email when their account is finally approved, so that users are never sent a temporary password and one-time login URL that will not work. You can modify this text at the !user_settings page."
