<h1>Static.module</h1>

<p class='intro'>Storage and retrieval of Drupal node content as plain
HTML files</p>
<h3>Intent:</h3>
<p>Every time a Drupal node is saved, a corresponding file is updated.
This means that content can be retained even if the database is
unavailable.</p>
<p>When retrieval is set to aggressive (always read) or intelligent (read if newer than node-modified date), the flat file will
be read back and displayed. This allows for HTML to be updated directly
from outside of Drupal.<br/>If left 'passive', Drupal node management continues as normal and the staic files are write-only, used for backup but not read back in again.</p>
<p>It can be used to serve legacy content, create backups, or provide
alternate renderings of the pages via XSL or similar.</p>
<p>It's also handy for testing the metadata and microformat retention as
pages get round-tripped in and out the importer.</p>
<p>
The files will be saved as annotated XHTML in a designated directory (configurable via admin/settings/static)
with a filename corresponding to its Drupal path - either the url alias+"htm" or "node/{n}.htm"
</p>
<h3>Using it to serve legacy pages</h3>
<p>
This setup can be used to serve externally maintained HTML files through a Drupal front-end.
If, for instance you have a process that writes to static HTML, this HTML can be forwarded through Drupal as a node.
If you wish to use a third party HTML editor and maintain your content that way, static HTML will just work, although creating new pages may be tricky.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, however, the input must be valid XHTML, and be of a format compatable to the normal static HTML output.
If it's not, then each page read needs to pass through the reasonbly intensive import_html import template process.
To enable this, check the 'advanced import' in the settings.
</p>
<p>
Note that choosing to rung the import_html process again will run it with <em>all</em>em> the current configurations set, such as taxonomy classification, user ownership etc.
