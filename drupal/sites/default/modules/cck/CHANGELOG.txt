5--1.10
=======

IMPORTANT : this release fixes (minor) cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
in nodereference.module, userreference.module and content_copy.module.
See the Security Annoucement on http://drupal.org/node/330546 for more information.

Other changes
- #316656 Default weight must be zero, not NULL, or form ordering will be incorrect.
- #309558 by mroswell : fix PHP doc typo.
- #281749 by asimmonds: fix '0' not parsed as an alias for allowed values.
- #308215 by Reg - Nodereference: Do not filter on empty string when querying for referenceable nodes.
- #318143 by Douggreen - Panels integration: make widget label translatable.

5--1.9
======

Hotfix release.
- Fix array_merge() warning on upgrade (harmless).
- Fix parse error in nodereference.module.

5--1.8
======

The 1.8 release fixes two critical bugs :

- #292872 Data loss issue : fields and field data deleted for content types defined by disabled modules.
IMPORTANT: Since disabling all contrib modules is a recommended step prior to upgrading a D5 site to D6,
it is highly advised that D5 sites using CCK are updated to CCK 5.x-1.8 before starting the D6 upgrade process.

- #271577 Security issue (moderate): unsanitized output for some admin-defined content
('administer content' permission was required to exploit the security hole)
IMPORTANT: If your theme uses field templates, you will need to manually change this line in your theme's template.php :
function phptemplate_field() :  [or possibly THEME_NAME_field()]
change:
  'label' => t($field['widget']['label']),
to:
  'label' => check_plain(t($field['widget']['label'])),


Other notable fix :

- Content Copy: Fix multiple bugs when importing/exporting content types :
exporting field definition can alter the actual field's settings
'this post cannot be referenced' error when exporting nodereference fields
no export of default values

This release requires a visit to update.php

Other changes :
- #196468 by Nedjo, add method to provide a link to automatically import a file into Content Copy.
- #296077 Add delta to formatter information.
- #128038 Alter _content_admin_form() to provide the raw widget default values as well as the default value widget so programmed forms will have those values available. You can't tell when you construct the form if it's a programmed form or not, so we will always have to create the default value widget, but we don't always have to use it. This will also get the default values into the Content Copy export in a way that Content Copy import can pick them up, and alter validation to unset the default value widget and skip the default value widget processing if it's a programmed form. Since we are now provided the actual default value (not just the default value widget) in the export, we can safely pick it up in the import.
- #128038 Use content_field_instance_collapse() to send form values in the Content Copy export to be sure we get the original field values for checkboxes instead of the true/false values we will get otherwise.
- #128038 Backport content_field_instance_collapse() and content_field_instance_expand() to make it easier to send field values to drupal_execute.
- #187599 Backport content_generate so Devel module can create data for CCK fields when creating nodes.
- #227951 by pwolanin: Add a permission for PHP 'default values' and 'allowed values'
- #179419 by smk-ka: Content Copy - Import fails when language not English.
- #157211 Nodereference: error message when no valid node with that title (autocomplete widget).
- #287540 Add index on nid in data tables, to optimize node deletion (requires update.php)
- #288578 Text: Fix max length to use utf8 length.
- #265795 by smk-ka: formatter labels go through t() twice in Views exposed data.
- #257250 by bangpound, sun, JohnAlbin - Panels integration: formatter not properly set.
- #256178 by douggreen - Text: fix warnings around views argument handler.
- #165314 by sleepcamel - Views integration: fix blank links in summary view.
- #299698 Userreference: fix autocompletion query when typed string is '0'.
- #266205 by sun: add zebra classes for field items.
- #301984 by joetsuihk - Views Integration: do not display empty divs on empty fields.
