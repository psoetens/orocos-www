UPDATING THE FREELINKING.MODULE
==================================================

The Drupal 4.5 and 4.6 versions of freelinking.module did not require a
database table to function. Due to the added functionality, freelinking
now requires a database table. Add it to your Drupal database in the
normal way, ie., a line like this:

$ mysql -u drupaluser -pdrupalpass drupaldb < freelinking.mysql

UPDATING FROM THE CVS (HEAD) VERSION OF FREELINKING.MODULE
==================================================

If you were using the CVS (also called "HEAD") version of
freelinking.module between Drupal versions 4.6 and 4.7, there is a
freelinking.install file included to handle the change in db schema
between the CVS and 4.7 versions of the module.
