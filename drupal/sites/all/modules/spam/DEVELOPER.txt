Spam logging guidelines
-----------------------

Per issue #532158.

A starting recommendation of items that should be logged, and at what level:

SPAM_LOG
* content marked as spam by spam.module, with final score
* content marked as spam or not-spam by user
* any "this is never supposed to happen" errors (as they're probably indicative of a bug)

SPAM_VERBOSE
* content marked as not-spam by spam module, with final score
* individual filters indicating spam, with scores

SPAM_DEBUG
* individual filters calculating all content score
* any internal processes that would be handy to expose for debugging
