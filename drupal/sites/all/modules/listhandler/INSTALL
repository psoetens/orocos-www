To use listhandler you should first install mailhandler. Installing
mailalias is considered a good idea.

1.)  Copy listhandler.module to the module directory of your drupal
     installation.

2.)  Enable the module in Site Configuration -> modules.

3.)  Create a forum that you wish to be the container for your list's
     messages (see docs for forum).

4.)  Configure a mailbox per mailing list in admin > mailhandler > add mailbox
     - specify the mailing lists sending address as the e-mail address, eg drupal-support-bounces@drupal.org.
     - specify the mailing lists address as second address, eg. drupal-support@drupal.org
     - configure your POP, IMAP mailbox or an mbox INBOX.
     - disable "security"
     - disable "send error replies"
     - From header: A header by that mails from that list can be uniquely determined.
       Sender is usually a good choice. This depends on the mailing list software.
     - Then give as a mailhandler default command:

     tid: 123

     where 123 would be the numeric taxonomy id of the forum you created above.

5.)  Create a dummy user which has the mailing list's sending address as
     his address. This user needs to have a role that has the "post content"
     and the "post comments" permission set.

6.)  listhandler creates accounts for posters to your lists that do not have
     an account on your site. In admin > listhandler > settings you can choose
     if those accounts are open or blocked my default.

7.)  While there you should enter an email address that can be used as a From 
     address for comments by anonymous users that get sent to your list.

8.) Subscribe the mailbox that you just configured to the mailing list in question. You do this outside of Drupal.
