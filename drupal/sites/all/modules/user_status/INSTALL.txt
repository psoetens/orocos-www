Installation:
-------------
1. Copy the user_status.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Enable the module by visiting admin -> modules

3. Configure the module under administer >> settings >> user_status
   - Enable notifications on each desired status change (activated,
     blocked, and/or deleted).
   - (Optionally) Customize notification subject and text.

4. If your site requires administrator approval for new users, you
   should modify the welcome email text to remove the initial password
   and one-time login URL. When the first email is generated, the
   user's account is blocked, so the initial login information will
   not work. Therefore, you should include this information in the
   notification email once the account is active, not the initial
   welcome email.  This text can be modified at the user settings
   page: administer >> settings >> users

5. Ensure your site's "E-mail address" setting is defined, which is
   used as the "From" header for all outgoing emails. You can find the
   setting on the administer >> settings page, under the "General
   settings" set of choices. If this is not set, the user status
   module will not be able to send notification emails.
